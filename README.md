# Rent vs Buy Calculator

An original, open-source rent vs buy calculator that compares long-run financial outcomes between purchasing a home and renting.

This project is inspired by the New York Times Upshot calculator methodology and inputs, but is an original implementation and design. See the NYT tool here: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step required.

## Features

- Basic inputs: home price, rent, time horizon
- Mortgage details: rate, down payment, term, PMI
- Advanced assumptions: growth rates for home price, rent, inflation, investment returns
- Taxes: property tax, marginal rate, itemized/standard deduction interaction, HOA partial deductibility
- Closing costs, maintenance, insurance, utilities, HOA fees
- Renting-side costs: security deposit, broker fee, renter insurance
- Opportunity cost of cash flows at user-defined return
- Summary totals and clear breakdowns

## Notes

- All outputs are estimates and simplified. Not financial advice.
- Standard deduction figures are approximate for 2025 and should be updated over time.
